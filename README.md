# Bachelor Thesis: ChatGPT Prompt Testing

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my Bachelor Thesis on ChatGPT prompt testing. The goal of this research is to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of various prompts in optimizing the performance of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI.

## Why These Tools?

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT was chosen for its versatility in natural language processing. Its flexibility allows for diverse applications, making it suitable for generating content relevant to OMR research.

### LaTeX
LaTeX serves as a powerful typesetting system, ideal for creating professional-looking scientific papers. Its advanced formatting capabilities are crucial for presenting research findings.

## How I Applied Them

### ChatGPT for Scoring and Chapter generation
I used ChatGPT to generate scores and one chapter for given abstracts for my research paper in the field of optical music recognition.

### LaTeX for Typesetting Scientific Papers
LaTeX played a key role in typesetting my chapter. Its precise control over text formatting, handling of bibliographies, and support for mathematical equations were indispensable.

## Issues and Drawbacks

### ChatGPT
- **Issues:**
  - Content generated may be logically correct but not always aligned with reality.
  - Lack of context between sentences can lead to inconsistent responses.
- **Drawbacks compared to other models:**
  - Proneness to nonsensical or fantastical thinking in responses.

### LaTeX
- **Issues:**
  - Requires a learning curve, which may be steep for new users.
  - Not ideal for real-time text editing.
- **Drawbacks compared to other tools:**
  - Less intuitive for simple documents compared to WYSIWYG interfaces.

**Note:** Drawbacks and issues may vary based on specific needs and user preferences.
